# ARTIFICAL-INTELLIGENCE

What is AI?

Artificial Intelligence (AI) is the ability of a machine or computer to think, learn, and make decisions like humans. It is a branch of computer science where we teach machines to perform tasks that usually require human intelligence, such as understanding language, recognizing images, solving problems, and making predictions.

Key Features of AI:
	1.	Learning: Machines learn from data and improve over time.
	2.	Reasoning: AI can make decisions based on logic and information.
	3.	Problem-Solving: AI helps solve complex problems quickly.
	4.	Automation: AI performs tasks automatically without constant human input.

Examples of AI:
	1.	Virtual Assistants: Siri, Alexa, and Google Assistant can answer your questions and follow voice commands.
	2.	Recommendation Systems: Netflix suggests movies and shows based on what youâ€™ve watched.
	3.	Self-Driving Cars: Cars like Tesla use AI to navigate roads and avoid obstacles.
	4.	Chatbots: Websites use chatbots to answer customer questions automatically.
	5.	Face Recognition: AI in smartphones unlocks the phone by recognizing your face.

Simple Example:
Imagine you teach a computer to recognize fruits. You show it pictures of apples, bananas, and oranges. Over time, the computer learns the patterns and can identify a fruit even if it has never seen that exact picture before. This is AI at work!
